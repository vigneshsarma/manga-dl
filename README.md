# Manga Dl

A command line utility to download Manga's from sites like mangareader.net.
Inspired from [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/)

## Example Usage
```shell
$ main.py "One Piece" 200 300
# downloads 'One Piece' chapters 200 300 in folder One_Piece.
```

## Todo
* support other sites like mangafox
* better cli interface
* better packaging with setup.py etc.
* try parallization/concurrency to improve performance.
